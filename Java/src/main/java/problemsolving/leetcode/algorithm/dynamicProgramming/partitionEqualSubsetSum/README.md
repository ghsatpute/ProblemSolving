# 416. Partition Equal Subset Sum

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if you can partition the 
array into two subsets such that the sum of the elements in both subsets is 
equal or `false` otherwise.

### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
```

## Constraints 
* `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
